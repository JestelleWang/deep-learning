# MVIG-training
SJTU MVIG dedicates to produce not only world-class research findings but also world-class AI talents. This plan is designed for zero-based but very smart students who will join SJTU MVIG following Stanford AI lab standard. The goal of this plan is to help students to establish a solid foundation on computer vision, deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. Frequent interactions between mentors and students will be an important part of this plan.

## Some Important Topics

There are five important topics to delve into:

- Object Detection
- Pose Estimation
- Multi-object tracking
- Object Segmentation
- Scene Parsing

Object Detection is the base, the others develop in different directions. Pose Estimation focuses on human segmentation, while I guess it is one of the most successful projects in MVIG so as to be included. Multi-object tracking is a decision-making problem and apply reinforcement learning. Object Segmentation try to understand the image but just focus on several objects, while Scene Parsing goes deeper and focus on the whole image.  

## A Small Project

> Please train an hourglass model for human part segmentation.

I think it is an combination of one model and another dataset. That's to say, it uses the model in a paper to train some other datasets. I don't know if it is reliability in math.  

I am interested in rewriting this <a href="https://github.com/anewell/pose-hg-train">code</a> by *pyTorch*. But time is limited, maybe I would fail.
