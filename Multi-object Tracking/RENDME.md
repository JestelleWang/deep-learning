# Multi-Object Tracking

**Background:**
Online-learning, the learning method conducting learning during tracking, is able to utilize features based on the status and the history of the target. However, there are no ground truth annotations available for supervision so that the method is likely to learn from incorrect training examples if there are errors in the tracking results and these errors can be accumulated and result in *tracking drift*.
